# üìà SARIMA Stock Forecasting Model for Investment Analysis

A comprehensive time series forecasting model using SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) to predict NASDAQ index trends for strategic investment decisions in technology stocks.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements advanced time series forecasting techniques to analyze and predict NASDAQ index movements, providing valuable insights for ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) investment strategies. By leveraging historical data from 1990 to 2022, the model identifies cyclical patterns and trends in the technology sector's performance.

The SARIMA model excels at capturing both trend and seasonal components in financial time series data, making it particularly suitable for stock market analysis where patterns repeat over different time horizons.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Historical Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of NASDAQ index data spanning over 30 years (1990-2022)
- **SARIMA Model Implementation**: Advanced seasonal time series forecasting with optimal parameter selection
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Breaks down time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive plots showing historical trends, forecasts, and confidence intervals
- **Model Validation**: Train/test split validation with performance metrics
- **Investment Insights**: Actionable forecasts for ETF investment strategies
- **Automated Data Pipeline**: Real-time data fetching from Yahoo Finance API

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lorenzpulgar/Forecast-model-with-SARIMA-for-stocks-investment.git
cd Forecast-model-with-SARIMA-for-stocks-investment
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas_datareader pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn
```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
